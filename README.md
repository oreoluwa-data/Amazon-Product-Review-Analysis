# 📦 Amazon Product Review Analysis

Welcome to my **Amazon Product Review Analysis** project!  
This case study showcases my data analysis skills using **Microsoft Excel** to extract insights from Amazon product and customer review data.

## 📊 Key Analysis Tasks

Using pivot tables, calculated columns, and helper fields, I answered the following business questions:

1. Average discount percentage by product category
2. Product count per category
3. Total number of reviews per category
4. Products with the highest average ratings
5. Average actual price vs. discounted price by category
6. Products with the highest number of reviews
7. Number of products with ≥50% discount
8. Rating distribution (e.g., how many are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)
9. Total potential revenue (`Discounted_Price × Rating_Count`) by category
10. Product count by price range bucket (`<₹200`, `₹200–₹500`, `>₹500`)
11. Relationship between rating and discount level
12. Products with fewer than 1,000 reviews
13. Categories with the highest discounts
14. Top 5 products combining rating and review count
